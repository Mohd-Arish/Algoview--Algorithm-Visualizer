<h2 align="center" font-weight="bold">AlgoView </h2>
AlgoView is an interactive algorithm visualization tool designed to help users understand and visualize the inner workings of various sorting algorithms and pathfinding algorithms. It provides an intuitive and engaging way to explore complex concepts through visual representation. Project Overview AlgoView is a web application developed with the aim of simplifying the learning process for algorithms. It offers visualizations for several sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. Additionally, it features a pathfinding tool that uses HTML5 canvas to demonstrate how different pathfinding algorithms navigate through obstacles to find the best route. 
<h3 align="left" font-weight="bold">Key Features- </h3>
<h4 align="left" font-weight="bold">Sorting Algorithm Visualizations: </h4> 
Bubble Sort: Visualizes the process of repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
Selection Sort: Shows how the smallest element is selected from the unsorted portion and swapped with the leftmost unsorted element. 
Quick Sort: Demonstrates the divide-and-conquer approach of selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around the pivot. 
Insertion Sort: Illustrates how each element is compared with the previous elements and placed in the correct position. 
<h4 align="left" font-weight="bold">Pathfinding Visualizer: </h4>
Utilizes HTML5 canvas to visually represent the process of finding the shortest path between two points while navigating through obstacles.
Supports interactive user input to create custom obstacle configurations and see how different algorithms handle them.
<h3 align="left" font-weight="bold">Main Technologies Used: </h3>
TypeScript: The primary language for implementing the logic and functionality of the application. 
HTML5: Used to structure the web pages and integrate canvas elements for visualization. 
CSS: Provides styling for the user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
<h3 align="left" font-weight="bold">How to Use-</h3>
<h4 align="left" font-weight="bold">Sorting Algorithms: </h4>
Select a sorting algorithm from the menu. Adjust the number of elements and speed of visualization using the provided sliders. 
Click "Try [Algorithm]" to see the algorithm in action. 
<h4 align="left" font-weight="bold">Pathfinding: </h4>
Select the pathfinding option from the menu. Use the canvas to draw obstacles. 
Click "Find Path" to see the pathfinding algorithm navigate through the obstacles.
